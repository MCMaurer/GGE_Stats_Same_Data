# GGE_Stats_Same_Data

In the UC Davis GGE Stats Support Group, aka [N.U.D.E Modeling](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gge-nude-modeling), we read a [very cool paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2515245917747646) where 29 different research teams analyzed the same dataset to investigate the same question. We wanna try something similar with an ecological data set!
